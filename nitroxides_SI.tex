	\caption{Evolution of the Born solvatation energy, $\Delta G^\star_{Born}$ (computed with Eq.~(4) of the main text) with the dielectric constant of the solvent (left) for different spherical cavities ($a$) and of the Debye-Huckel correction, $\Delta G^\star_{DH}$  (computed with Eq.~(5) of the main text) with the concentration in electrolyte, $[X]$ (right) in water and acetontrile.}

\caption{Impact of the concentration of electrolyte on the formal oxidation (plain lines, computed with Eq.~(9) of the main text) and reduction (dashed lines, computed with Eq.~(10) of the main text) potentials, $E^f_{abs}$, considering a fictitious case where $E^0_{abs} = \SI{0}{\volt}$.}

\caption{Evolution of the pairing energy, $\Delta G^\star_{pair}$ (computed with Eq.~(11) of the main text) between two ions with the ratio between the radii of the two ions ($\chi$) and for increasing dipole cavity shapes ($s$). Their charge is set to 1 and -1. The equilibrium constant, $K_{pair} = e^{-\frac{\Delta G^\star_{pair}}{RT}}$, is reported.}
