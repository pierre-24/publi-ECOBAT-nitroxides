	abstract = {A colleague at the Technical University of Denmark has often stated: ``Life is too short for electrolytes''. Another well-known scientist in the field of molecular simulation has recently said during an international Thermodynamics conference: ``All my life I have tried to keep myself away from water and electrolytes''. Sadly, what these statements correctly imply is that there are far too many unclear questions and concepts in electrolyte thermodynamics, and associated difficulties in modeling electrolyte solutions. In this work, we attempt to shed some light on some important concepts and misconceptions in electrolyte thermodynamics associated with the development of electrolyte equations of state, with emphasis on those based on the Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory. Detailed mathematics is needed for some of the derivations but for brevity and in order to emphasize the principles rather than the derivations, the latter are omitted. We first discuss the peculiarities of electrolyte thermodynamics and associated modeling and continue with a literature review of equations of state for electrolyte solutions. Next we will provide a modern derivation of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel and Born equations and discuss their assumptions in detail to answer some of the confusion that exists in current literature on the applicability ranges and show how the different versions of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel and Born models are related. A discussion and outlook section conclude this review. Several of the statements in this work challenge ``accepted beliefs'' in electrolyte thermodynamics and, while we believe that this challenge is justified, we hope that a useful debate can result in improved and predictive thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions.},

We consider two main approaches, the first one is based in classical thermodynamics, which has been used in the original work of Debye and Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel, leading to the model which has been an important cornerstone of electrolyte thermodynamics since its original publication in 1923. The second approach relies on more modern derivations based on statistical mechanics, the so-called charging approaches. Both derivation routes have differences and shortcomings. We demonstrate the necessary steps to reach all original models derived from the Debye-Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel model and further explore their capabilities and limitations concerning individual ion, and mean ionic activity coefficients for different size dissimilarities scenarios between ions. One immediate conclusion is that there is an unnecessary consideration in the Debye and Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel derivation which is cancelled by another one they have made, leading to a correct expression for the activity coefficient. Also, the long-lasting consideration that both the Debye and Gu{\textasciidieresis}ntelberg charging processes lead to the same thermodynamic properties is demonstrated to be inaccurate, as it is rigorously true only when a common distance of closest approach is used.},

Both the bulk dielectric constant and the Debye screening lengths are determined from the bulk dielectric function of the polar fluid. The linear combination coefficients of the response modes are evaluated in a self-consistent way and can be used to evaluate the electrostatic contribution to the thermodynamic properties of a polar fluid.

The basics of continuum electrostatics are described, including the nonequilibrium polarization response upon excitation or ionization of the solute. Nonelectrostatic interactions, which must be included in the model in order to obtain accurate solvation energies, are also described. Numerical techniques for implementing the equations are discussed, including linear-scaling algorithms that can be used in classical or mixed quantum/classical biomolecular electrostatics calculations.

	abstract = {Nitroxide radicals have previously been successfully used as electrodes in all-organic radical batteries. However, one drawback of these batteries is significantly reduced redox potentials, in comparison to that of widely used lithium-ion batteries, making their energy-producing capacity rather small for use as a primary battery. In addition, strong propensity of nitroxide radicals to engage in side reactions with traditional electrolytes based on molecular solvents give rise to a series of undesirable and irreversible byproducts, thus significantly reducing the life of nitroxide batteries. Ionic liquids (ILs) have previously demonstrated their ability to reduce the reactivity of radicals through strong intermolecular interactions. In this study, we investigate the use of ILs as electrolytes with the view of increasing redox potentials of nitroxide radicals. A series of imidazolium, phosphonium, and pyrrolidinium-based ILs coupled with widely used anions were chosen to predict redox potentials of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy nitroxide (TEMPO) radical using state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations using one and two ion pairs to describe ILs. Some ILs showed a significant increase in the redox potential of this radical to reach as much as 5.5 eV, compared to the previously measured value of 2.2 eV in aqueous media. In particular, ILs were shown to stabilize the aminoxy anion, the reduced form of the nitroxide radical, which has not been achieved previously in traditional solvents. Although a simple model consisting of one and two ion pairs was used in the current study, these findings clearly demonstrate that ILs have a huge potential in improving redox potentials of nitroxide radicals.},

Accurate oxidation and reduction potentials to within 40 mV (3.9 kJ mol-1) of experimental values were found using G3(MP2)-RAD//B3-LYP/6-31G(d) gas-phase energies and PCM solvation calculations at the B3-LYP/6-31G(d) level. For larger systems, an ONIOM method in which G3(MP2)-RAD calculations for the core are combined with lower-cost RMP2/6-311+G(3df,2p) calculations for the full system, was able to approximate G3(MP2)-RAD values (to within 1.6 kJ mol-1) at a fraction of the computational cost. The overall ring structure has more effect on the electrode potentials than the inclusion of substituents. Azaphenalene derivatives display the lowest oxidation potentials and least negative reduction potentials and are thus the most promising target to function as antioxidants in biological systems. Piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives have intermediate oxidation potentials but on average pyrrolidine derivatives display more negative reduction potentials. Isoindoline derivatives show higher oxidation potentials and more negative reduction potentials. Within a ring, the substituents have a relatively small effect with electron donating groups such as amino and hydroxy groups stabilizing the oxidized species and electron withdrawing groups such as carboxy groups stabilizing the reduced species, as expected.},

While this approach can successfully account for basic length and energy scales of ion solvation, computer simulations indicate not only its quantitative inaccuracies but also its inability to capture some basic and important aspects of microscopic polarization response. Here, we consider one such shortcoming, a failure to distinguish the solvation thermodynamics of cations from that of otherwise-identical anions, and we pursue a simple, physically inspired modification of the dielectric continuum model to address it. The adaptation is motivated by analyzing the orientational response of an isolated water molecule whose dipole is rigidly constrained. Its free energy suggests a Hamiltonian for dipole fluctuations that accounts implicitly for the influence of higher-order multipole moments while respecting constraints of molecular geometry. We propose a field theory with the suggested form, whose nonlinear response breaks the charge symmetry of ion solvation. An approximate variational solution of this theory, with a single adjustable parameter, yields solvation free energies that agree closely with simulation results over a considerable range of solute size and charge.},

The model invokes damping functions to account for solute{\textendash}solvent wave function overlap. The assumptions made are very similar to those used in the Born model. This provides consistency and additivity of electrostatic and dispersion (quantum mechanical) interactions. The energy increases in magnitude with cation size, but decreases slightly with size for the highly polarizable anions. The higher order multipole moments are essential, making up more than 50\% of the dispersion solvation energy of the fluoride ion. This method provides an accurate and simple way of calculating the notoriously problematic dispersion contribution to the solvation energy. The result establishes the importance of using accurate calculations of the dispersion energy for the modeling of solvation.},

The method is based on the compensation of the solvophobic effects in the difference of the redox potentials of two oxidation steps of large compact particles. Corresponding measurements have been made for the cobaltocene and dicarbollylnickel systems. On this basis, scales of ion transfer energies and electrode potentials in different solvents have been developed. It has been shown that the transfer energy of large ions in aprotic solvents obeys the Born equation. This implies two consequences. First, it is necessary to revise the existing version of the non-local electrostatics theory which overestimates the effect of the space correlation of polarization. Second, our results provide sufficient justification for the use of the Marcus equation for calculation of the reorganization energy of the reactions of large ions and, hence, the validity of the conclusions drawn with its use (in particular, on the influence of the time of longitudinal dielectric relaxation of the medium on the electron transfer kinetics).},

In this work, we analyze and discuss various modifications to the Born equation. We verify their performance for Gibbs Free Energy, Enthalpy, and Entropy of solvation using data from a comprehensive database of 143 ions with charges from -4 to ＋4 in 26 different solvents. We show how the Born radius is a natural consequence of introducing the dielectric saturation effect in an approximate form, and therefore most of the proposed models are special cases of considering a continuous radial dependence for the dielectric constant. Finally, we propose a new analytical modification to the Born equation, which encloses the previous theoretical modifications and has a better performance than previous modifications.},

	abstract = {If the molecules of a given solvent possess significant quadrupolar moment, the macroscopic Maxwell equations must involve the contribution of the density of the quadrupolar moment to the electric displacement field. This modifies the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and all consequences from it. In this work, the structure of the diffuse atmosphere around an ion dissolved in quadrupolarizable medium is analyzed by solving the quadrupolar variant of the Coulomb-Ampere's law of electrostatics. The results are compared to the classical Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory. The quadrupolar version of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel potential of a point charge is finite even in r = 0. The ion-quadrupole interaction yields a significant expansion of the diffuse atmosphere of the ion and, thus, it decreases the Debye-H{\"u}ckel energy. In addition, since the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte solutions depends strongly on concentration, the Born energy of the dissolved ions alters with concentration, which has a considerable contribution to the activity coefficient {$\gamma\pm$} known as the self-salting-out effect. The quadrupolarizability of the medium damps strongly the self-salting-out of the electrolyte, and thus it affects additionally {$\gamma\pm$}. Comparison with experimental data for {$\gamma\pm$} for various electrolytes allows for the estimation of the quadrupolar length of water: LQ {$\approx$} 2 {\AA}, in good agreement with previous assessments. The effect of quadrupolarizability is especially important in non-aqueous solutions. Data for the activity of NaBr in methanol is used to determine the quadrupolarizability of methanol with good accuracy.},

In such species, deprotonation of the acid fragment can stabilize the remote radical by tens of kilojoules, or, analogously, formation of a stable radical (by abstraction or homolytic cleavage reactions) increases the acidity of a remote acid by several pKa units. This stabilization can be broadly classified as a new type of polar effect that originates in Coloumbic interactions but, in contrast to standard polar effects, persists in radicals with no chargeseparated (i.e., dipole) resonance contributors, is nondirectional, and hence of extremely broad scope. The stabilization upon deprotonation is largest when a highly delocalized radical is combined with an initially less stable anion (i.e., the conjugate base of a weaker acid), and is negligible for highly localized radicals and/or stable anions. The effect is largest in the gas phase and lowpolarity solvents but is quenched in water, where the anion is sufficiently stabilized. These simple rules can be employed to design various switchable compounds able to reversibly release radicals in response to pH for use in, for example, organic synthesis or nitroxide-mediated polymerization. Moreover, given its wide chemical scope, this effect is likely to influence the protonation state of many biological substrates under radical attack and may contribute to enzyme catalysis.},

Moreover, regular orbital order is restored on protonation of the anionic fragment, and hence the orbital configuration can be switched by pH. Most importantly, our theoretical and experimental results reveal a dramatically higher radical stability and proton acidity of such distonic radical anions.

It was found that both Hammett constants (               {$\sigma$}               p               ) of the substituents on the nitroxide radicals and hyperfine splitting constants of the respective nitrogen atoms (               {$\alpha$}               N               ) were well correlated to their experimental oxidation potentials. Theoretical calculations, carried out at the G3(MP2,CC)(+)//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory with PCM solvation corrections, were shown to reproduce experiments to within a mean absolute deviation of 33 mV, with a maximum deviation of 64 mV. The oxidation potentials of the nitroxides examined varied over 400 mV, depending on ring size and substitution. This considerable variation can be rationalised by the ability of various substituents to electrostatically stabilize the oxidised oxoammonium cation. Importantly, this can be quantified by a simple predictive relationship involving the distance scaled dipole and quadrupole moments of the analogous cyclohexyl ring. This highlights the often-overlooked role of through-space electrostatic substituent effects, even in formally neutral compounds.},

	abstract = {Cyclic nitroxides demonstrate antioxidative activity in numerous in vitro and in vivo models, which frequently involves the participation of the reduced and oxidized forms of the nitroxide, namely, the hydroxylamine and oxoammonium cation. Generally, cellular reducing equivalents facilitate rapid enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic reduction of nitroxides in the tissue. On the other hand, the reaction of nitroxides with various radicals yields the highly oxidizing oxoammonium cation, which mediates the catalytic effect of nitroxides in selective oxidation of alcohols. Hence, nitroxides might act as both anti- and pro-oxidants. Therefore, the comproportionation reaction between the oxoammonium cation and the hydroxylamine might play a role in lowering the pro-oxidative activity of nitroxides. Although the comproportionation reaction has previously been studied, there is no agreement regarding its kinetic features. We investigated the reaction of the reduced forms of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (TPO) and 4-OH-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (4-OH-TPO) with the oxoammonium cation derived from TPO at various pHs using rapid-mixing stopped-flow and EPR spectrometry. From the pH dependence of the reaction rate constants we determined the pK1 of the respective hydroxylamines to be 7.5 and 6.9, respectively. The reduction potentials of the hydroxylamines were determined by cyclic voltammetry, and from their dependence on pH, we obtained the same pK1 values. The rate constant of the comproportionation reaction does not exceed 20 M-1 s-1 in the physiological pH range and, therefore, cannot greatly contribute toward recycling of the nitroxides in the tissue.},

All nitroxide derivatives react slowly with O2{\textbullet}- and are relatively inefficient SOD mimics at physiological pH. Even piperidine nitroxides, having the highest SOD-like activity, demonstrate a catalytic activity of about 1000-fold lower than that of native SOD at pH 7.4. The present results do not indicate any correlation between the kinetics of HO2{\textbullet}/O2{\textbullet}-, {\textbullet}NO2 and CO3{\textbullet}- removal by nitroxides and their protective activity against biological oxidative stress and emphasize the importance of target-oriented nitroxides, i.e., interaction between the biological target and specific nitroxides.},

The model is called SMD, where the ``D'' stands for ``density'' to denote that the full solute electron density is used without defining partial atomic charges. ``Continuum'' denotes that the solvent is not represented explicitly but rather as a dielectric medium with surface tension at the solute-solvent boundary. SMD is a universal solvation model, where ``universal'' denotes its applicability to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known (in particular, dielectric constant, refractive index, bulk surface tension, and acidity and basicity parameters). The model separates the observable solvation free energy into two main components. The first component is the bulk electrostatic contribution arising from a self-consistent reaction field treatment that involves the solution of the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for electrostatics in terms of the integral-equation-formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM). The cavities for the bulk electrostatic calculation are defined by superpositions of nuclear-centered spheres. The second component is called the cavity-dispersion-solvent-structure term and is the contribution arising from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell. This contribution is a sum of terms that are proportional (with geometry-dependent proportionality constants called atomic surface tensions) to the solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. The SMD model has been parametrized with a training set of 2821 solvation data including 112 aqueous ionic solvation free energies, 220 solvation free energies for 166 ions in acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide, 2346 solvation free energies for 318 neutral solutes in 91 solvents (90 nonaqueous organic solvents and water), and 143 transfer free energies for 93 neutral solutes between water and 15 organic solvents. The elements present in the solutes are H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, and Br. The SMD model employs a single set of parameters (intrinsic atomic Coulomb radii and atomic surface tension coefficients) optimized over six electronic structure methods: M05-2X/MIDI!6D, M05-2X/6-31G*, M05-2X/6-31+G**, M05-2X/cc-pVTZ, B3LYP/6-31G*, and HF/6-31G*. Although the SMD model has been parametrized using the IEF-PCM protocol for bulk electrostatics, it may also be employed with other algorithms for solving the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for continuum solvation calculations in which the solute is represented by its electron density in real space. This includes, for example, the conductor-like screening algorithm. With the 6-31G* basis set, the SMD model achieves mean unsigned errors of 0.6-1.0 kcal/mol in the solvation free energies of tested neutrals and mean unsigned errors of 4 kcal/mol on average for ions with either Gaussian03 or GAMESS.},

	abstract = {We present a dielectric continuum model that, at a semiquantitative level, explains why ion pair formation in water is favored by like-sized ions over unlike-sized pairs. Using both classical and ab initio continuum approaches, we show that the now well-established empirical rule, the so-called ``law of matching water affinities'', can be rationalized in terms of ion solvation. Namely, pairing of differently sized ions is weakened due to a shadowing effect where the larger ion shields the smaller ion from the solvent. It is shown that this empirical law ceases to be valid for less polar solvents where strong ion-ion coulomb interactions dominate the pairing free energy. The presented model demonstrates that certain ion-specific effects, such as those connected with the Hofmeister series, can be qualitatively captured by classical continuum electrostatics, although a fully quantitative description would require explicit molecular treatment of the solvent.},
