	abstract = {A colleague at the Technical University of Denmark has often stated: ``Life is too short for electrolytes''. Another well-known scientist in the field of molecular simulation has recently said during an international Thermodynamics conference: ``All my life I have tried to keep myself away from water and electrolytes''. Sadly, what these statements correctly imply is that there are far too many unclear questions and concepts in electrolyte thermodynamics, and associated difficulties in modeling electrolyte solutions. In this work, we attempt to shed some light on some important concepts and misconceptions in electrolyte thermodynamics associated with the development of electrolyte equations of state, with emphasis on those based on the Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory. Detailed mathematics is needed for some of the derivations but for brevity and in order to emphasize the principles rather than the derivations, the latter are omitted. We first discuss the peculiarities of electrolyte thermodynamics and associated modeling and continue with a literature review of equations of state for electrolyte solutions. Next we will provide a modern derivation of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel and Born equations and discuss their assumptions in detail to answer some of the confusion that exists in current literature on the applicability ranges and show how the different versions of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel and Born models are related. A discussion and outlook section conclude this review. Several of the statements in this work challenge ``accepted beliefs'' in electrolyte thermodynamics and, while we believe that this challenge is justified, we hope that a useful debate can result in improved and predictive thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions.},

We consider two main approaches, the first one is based in classical thermodynamics, which has been used in the original work of Debye and Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel, leading to the model which has been an important cornerstone of electrolyte thermodynamics since its original publication in 1923. The second approach relies on more modern derivations based on statistical mechanics, the so-called charging approaches. Both derivation routes have differences and shortcomings. We demonstrate the necessary steps to reach all original models derived from the Debye-Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel model and further explore their capabilities and limitations concerning individual ion, and mean ionic activity coefficients for different size dissimilarities scenarios between ions. One immediate conclusion is that there is an unnecessary consideration in the Debye and Hu{\textasciidieresis}ckel derivation which is cancelled by another one they have made, leading to a correct expression for the activity coefficient. Also, the long-lasting consideration that both the Debye and Gu{\textasciidieresis}ntelberg charging processes lead to the same thermodynamic properties is demonstrated to be inaccurate, as it is rigorously true only when a common distance of closest approach is used.},

Both the bulk dielectric constant and the Debye screening lengths are determined from the bulk dielectric function of the polar fluid. The linear combination coefficients of the response modes are evaluated in a self-consistent way and can be used to evaluate the electrostatic contribution to the thermodynamic properties of a polar fluid.

The basics of continuum electrostatics are described, including the nonequilibrium polarization response upon excitation or ionization of the solute. Nonelectrostatic interactions, which must be included in the model in order to obtain accurate solvation energies, are also described. Numerical techniques for implementing the equations are discussed, including linear-scaling algorithms that can be used in classical or mixed quantum/classical biomolecular electrostatics calculations.

	abstract = {Nitroxide radicals have previously been successfully used as electrodes in all-organic radical batteries. However, one drawback of these batteries is significantly reduced redox potentials, in comparison to that of widely used lithium-ion batteries, making their energy-producing capacity rather small for use as a primary battery. In addition, strong propensity of nitroxide radicals to engage in side reactions with traditional electrolytes based on molecular solvents give rise to a series of undesirable and irreversible byproducts, thus significantly reducing the life of nitroxide batteries. Ionic liquids (ILs) have previously demonstrated their ability to reduce the reactivity of radicals through strong intermolecular interactions. In this study, we investigate the use of ILs as electrolytes with the view of increasing redox potentials of nitroxide radicals. A series of imidazolium, phosphonium, and pyrrolidinium-based ILs coupled with widely used anions were chosen to predict redox potentials of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy nitroxide (TEMPO) radical using state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations using one and two ion pairs to describe ILs. Some ILs showed a significant increase in the redox potential of this radical to reach as much as 5.5 eV, compared to the previously measured value of 2.2 eV in aqueous media. In particular, ILs were shown to stabilize the aminoxy anion, the reduced form of the nitroxide radical, which has not been achieved previously in traditional solvents. Although a simple model consisting of one and two ion pairs was used in the current study, these findings clearly demonstrate that ILs have a huge potential in improving redox potentials of nitroxide radicals.},

Accurate oxidation and reduction potentials to within 40 mV (3.9 kJ mol-1) of experimental values were found using G3(MP2)-RAD//B3-LYP/6-31G(d) gas-phase energies and PCM solvation calculations at the B3-LYP/6-31G(d) level. For larger systems, an ONIOM method in which G3(MP2)-RAD calculations for the core are combined with lower-cost RMP2/6-311+G(3df,2p) calculations for the full system, was able to approximate G3(MP2)-RAD values (to within 1.6 kJ mol-1) at a fraction of the computational cost. The overall ring structure has more effect on the electrode potentials than the inclusion of substituents. Azaphenalene derivatives display the lowest oxidation potentials and least negative reduction potentials and are thus the most promising target to function as antioxidants in biological systems. Piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives have intermediate oxidation potentials but on average pyrrolidine derivatives display more negative reduction potentials. Isoindoline derivatives show higher oxidation potentials and more negative reduction potentials. Within a ring, the substituents have a relatively small effect with electron donating groups such as amino and hydroxy groups stabilizing the oxidized species and electron withdrawing groups such as carboxy groups stabilizing the reduced species, as expected.},

While this approach can successfully account for basic length and energy scales of ion solvation, computer simulations indicate not only its quantitative inaccuracies but also its inability to capture some basic and important aspects of microscopic polarization response. Here, we consider one such shortcoming, a failure to distinguish the solvation thermodynamics of cations from that of otherwise-identical anions, and we pursue a simple, physically inspired modification of the dielectric continuum model to address it. The adaptation is motivated by analyzing the orientational response of an isolated water molecule whose dipole is rigidly constrained. Its free energy suggests a Hamiltonian for dipole fluctuations that accounts implicitly for the influence of higher-order multipole moments while respecting constraints of molecular geometry. We propose a field theory with the suggested form, whose nonlinear response breaks the charge symmetry of ion solvation. An approximate variational solution of this theory, with a single adjustable parameter, yields solvation free energies that agree closely with simulation results over a considerable range of solute size and charge.},

The model invokes damping functions to account for solute{\textendash}solvent wave function overlap. The assumptions made are very similar to those used in the Born model. This provides consistency and additivity of electrostatic and dispersion (quantum mechanical) interactions. The energy increases in magnitude with cation size, but decreases slightly with size for the highly polarizable anions. The higher order multipole moments are essential, making up more than 50\% of the dispersion solvation energy of the fluoride ion. This method provides an accurate and simple way of calculating the notoriously problematic dispersion contribution to the solvation energy. The result establishes the importance of using accurate calculations of the dispersion energy for the modeling of solvation.},

The method is based on the compensation of the solvophobic effects in the difference of the redox potentials of two oxidation steps of large compact particles. Corresponding measurements have been made for the cobaltocene and dicarbollylnickel systems. On this basis, scales of ion transfer energies and electrode potentials in different solvents have been developed. It has been shown that the transfer energy of large ions in aprotic solvents obeys the Born equation. This implies two consequences. First, it is necessary to revise the existing version of the non-local electrostatics theory which overestimates the effect of the space correlation of polarization. Second, our results provide sufficient justification for the use of the Marcus equation for calculation of the reorganization energy of the reactions of large ions and, hence, the validity of the conclusions drawn with its use (in particular, on the influence of the time of longitudinal dielectric relaxation of the medium on the electron transfer kinetics).},

In this work, we analyze and discuss various modifications to the Born equation. We verify their performance for Gibbs Free Energy, Enthalpy, and Entropy of solvation using data from a comprehensive database of 143 ions with charges from -4 to ＋4 in 26 different solvents. We show how the Born radius is a natural consequence of introducing the dielectric saturation effect in an approximate form, and therefore most of the proposed models are special cases of considering a continuous radial dependence for the dielectric constant. Finally, we propose a new analytical modification to the Born equation, which encloses the previous theoretical modifications and has a better performance than previous modifications.},

	abstract = {If the molecules of a given solvent possess significant quadrupolar moment, the macroscopic Maxwell equations must involve the contribution of the density of the quadrupolar moment to the electric displacement field. This modifies the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and all consequences from it. In this work, the structure of the diffuse atmosphere around an ion dissolved in quadrupolarizable medium is analyzed by solving the quadrupolar variant of the Coulomb-Ampere's law of electrostatics. The results are compared to the classical Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory. The quadrupolar version of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel potential of a point charge is finite even in r = 0. The ion-quadrupole interaction yields a significant expansion of the diffuse atmosphere of the ion and, thus, it decreases the Debye-H{\"u}ckel energy. In addition, since the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte solutions depends strongly on concentration, the Born energy of the dissolved ions alters with concentration, which has a considerable contribution to the activity coefficient {$\gamma\pm$} known as the self-salting-out effect. The quadrupolarizability of the medium damps strongly the self-salting-out of the electrolyte, and thus it affects additionally {$\gamma\pm$}. Comparison with experimental data for {$\gamma\pm$} for various electrolytes allows for the estimation of the quadrupolar length of water: LQ {$\approx$} 2 {\AA}, in good agreement with previous assessments. The effect of quadrupolarizability is especially important in non-aqueous solutions. Data for the activity of NaBr in methanol is used to determine the quadrupolarizability of methanol with good accuracy.},

In such species, deprotonation of the acid fragment can stabilize the remote radical by tens of kilojoules, or, analogously, formation of a stable radical (by abstraction or homolytic cleavage reactions) increases the acidity of a remote acid by several pKa units. This stabilization can be broadly classified as a new type of polar effect that originates in Coloumbic interactions but, in contrast to standard polar effects, persists in radicals with no chargeseparated (i.e., dipole) resonance contributors, is nondirectional, and hence of extremely broad scope. The stabilization upon deprotonation is largest when a highly delocalized radical is combined with an initially less stable anion (i.e., the conjugate base of a weaker acid), and is negligible for highly localized radicals and/or stable anions. The effect is largest in the gas phase and lowpolarity solvents but is quenched in water, where the anion is sufficiently stabilized. These simple rules can be employed to design various switchable compounds able to reversibly release radicals in response to pH for use in, for example, organic synthesis or nitroxide-mediated polymerization. Moreover, given its wide chemical scope, this effect is likely to influence the protonation state of many biological substrates under radical attack and may contribute to enzyme catalysis.},

Moreover, regular orbital order is restored on protonation of the anionic fragment, and hence the orbital configuration can be switched by pH. Most importantly, our theoretical and experimental results reveal a dramatically higher radical stability and proton acidity of such distonic radical anions.

It was found that both Hammett constants (               {$\sigma$}               p               ) of the substituents on the nitroxide radicals and hyperfine splitting constants of the respective nitrogen atoms (               {$\alpha$}               N               ) were well correlated to their experimental oxidation potentials. Theoretical calculations, carried out at the G3(MP2,CC)(+)//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory with PCM solvation corrections, were shown to reproduce experiments to within a mean absolute deviation of 33 mV, with a maximum deviation of 64 mV. The oxidation potentials of the nitroxides examined varied over 400 mV, depending on ring size and substitution. This considerable variation can be rationalised by the ability of various substituents to electrostatically stabilize the oxidised oxoammonium cation. Importantly, this can be quantified by a simple predictive relationship involving the distance scaled dipole and quadrupole moments of the analogous cyclohexyl ring. This highlights the often-overlooked role of through-space electrostatic substituent effects, even in formally neutral compounds.},

	abstract = {Cyclic nitroxides demonstrate antioxidative activity in numerous in vitro and in vivo models, which frequently involves the participation of the reduced and oxidized forms of the nitroxide, namely, the hydroxylamine and oxoammonium cation. Generally, cellular reducing equivalents facilitate rapid enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic reduction of nitroxides in the tissue. On the other hand, the reaction of nitroxides with various radicals yields the highly oxidizing oxoammonium cation, which mediates the catalytic effect of nitroxides in selective oxidation of alcohols. Hence, nitroxides might act as both anti- and pro-oxidants. Therefore, the comproportionation reaction between the oxoammonium cation and the hydroxylamine might play a role in lowering the pro-oxidative activity of nitroxides. Although the comproportionation reaction has previously been studied, there is no agreement regarding its kinetic features. We investigated the reaction of the reduced forms of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (TPO) and 4-OH-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (4-OH-TPO) with the oxoammonium cation derived from TPO at various pHs using rapid-mixing stopped-flow and EPR spectrometry. From the pH dependence of the reaction rate constants we determined the pK1 of the respective hydroxylamines to be 7.5 and 6.9, respectively. The reduction potentials of the hydroxylamines were determined by cyclic voltammetry, and from their dependence on pH, we obtained the same pK1 values. The rate constant of the comproportionation reaction does not exceed 20 M-1 s-1 in the physiological pH range and, therefore, cannot greatly contribute toward recycling of the nitroxides in the tissue.},

All nitroxide derivatives react slowly with O2{\textbullet}- and are relatively inefficient SOD mimics at physiological pH. Even piperidine nitroxides, having the highest SOD-like activity, demonstrate a catalytic activity of about 1000-fold lower than that of native SOD at pH 7.4. The present results do not indicate any correlation between the kinetics of HO2{\textbullet}/O2{\textbullet}-, {\textbullet}NO2 and CO3{\textbullet}- removal by nitroxides and their protective activity against biological oxidative stress and emphasize the importance of target-oriented nitroxides, i.e., interaction between the biological target and specific nitroxides.},

The model is called SMD, where the ``D'' stands for ``density'' to denote that the full solute electron density is used without defining partial atomic charges. ``Continuum'' denotes that the solvent is not represented explicitly but rather as a dielectric medium with surface tension at the solute-solvent boundary. SMD is a universal solvation model, where ``universal'' denotes its applicability to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known (in particular, dielectric constant, refractive index, bulk surface tension, and acidity and basicity parameters). The model separates the observable solvation free energy into two main components. The first component is the bulk electrostatic contribution arising from a self-consistent reaction field treatment that involves the solution of the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for electrostatics in terms of the integral-equation-formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM). The cavities for the bulk electrostatic calculation are defined by superpositions of nuclear-centered spheres. The second component is called the cavity-dispersion-solvent-structure term and is the contribution arising from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell. This contribution is a sum of terms that are proportional (with geometry-dependent proportionality constants called atomic surface tensions) to the solvent-accessible surface areas of the individual atoms of the solute. The SMD model has been parametrized with a training set of 2821 solvation data including 112 aqueous ionic solvation free energies, 220 solvation free energies for 166 ions in acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide, 2346 solvation free energies for 318 neutral solutes in 91 solvents (90 nonaqueous organic solvents and water), and 143 transfer free energies for 93 neutral solutes between water and 15 organic solvents. The elements present in the solutes are H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, and Br. The SMD model employs a single set of parameters (intrinsic atomic Coulomb radii and atomic surface tension coefficients) optimized over six electronic structure methods: M05-2X/MIDI!6D, M05-2X/6-31G*, M05-2X/6-31+G**, M05-2X/cc-pVTZ, B3LYP/6-31G*, and HF/6-31G*. Although the SMD model has been parametrized using the IEF-PCM protocol for bulk electrostatics, it may also be employed with other algorithms for solving the nonhomogeneous Poisson equation for continuum solvation calculations in which the solute is represented by its electron density in real space. This includes, for example, the conductor-like screening algorithm. With the 6-31G* basis set, the SMD model achieves mean unsigned errors of 0.6-1.0 kcal/mol in the solvation free energies of tested neutrals and mean unsigned errors of 4 kcal/mol on average for ions with either Gaussian03 or GAMESS.},

Using both classical and ab initio continuum approaches, we show that the now well-established empirical rule, the so-called ``law of matching water affinities'', can be rationalized in terms of ion solvation. Namely, pairing of differently sized ions is weakened due to a shadowing effect where the larger ion shields the smaller ion from the solvent. It is shown that this empirical law ceases to be valid for less polar solvents where strong ion-ion coulomb interactions dominate the pairing free energy. The presented model demonstrates that certain ion-specific effects, such as those connected with the Hofmeister series, can be qualitatively captured by classical continuum electrostatics, although a fully quantitative description would require explicit molecular treatment of the solvent.},

The kinetics of such reactions has been thoroughly investigated under ideal conditions (Butler and Volmer or Marcus theories) considering the Frumkin effects; however, the electron-transfer in concentrated electrolytes still lacks a general theory. Here we discuss the effect of the concentration of the supporting electrolyte (an inert salt) on the kinetics of three redox couples with different nominal charge: hexaammineruthenium, ferricyanide and ferrocene methanol. The redox couples are diluted but the supporting electrolyte concentration is high enough that significant deviations of the formal electrode potential from the ideality are observed; the kinetics is also altered. We propose a model in which the electrostatic interactions are described as a complexation between the redox active species and the counter-ions of the supporting electrolyte, in analogy with the treatment of the ion pairs. The model correctly fits the dependence of the formal potential and of the charge transfer resistance on the concentration, thus suggesting that the ion-transfer accompanying an electron-transfer plays a significant role in the overall reaction kinetics. This finding enables a more realistic description of the complex electron-transfer reactions occurring e.g., in electrocatalysis and catalysis, bioelectrochemistry and biochemistry, and electrochemical energy storage.},

In this paper, we present the properties and application of nitroxides as antioxidants and anticancer drugs. The mostly used nitroxides in biology and medicine are a group of heterocyclic nitroxide derivatives of piperidine, pyrroline and pyrrolidine. The antioxidant action of nitroxides is associated with their redox cycle. Nitroxides, unlike other antioxidants, are characterized by a catalytic mechanism of action associated with a single electron oxidation and reduction reaction. In biological conditions, they mimic superoxide dismutase (SOD), modulate hemoprotein's catalase-like activity, scavenge reactive free radicals, inhibit the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions and suppress the oxidation of biological materials (peptides, proteins, lipids, etc.). The use of nitroxides as antioxidants against oxidative stress induced by anticancer drugs has also been investigated. The application of nitroxides and their derivatives as anticancer drugs is discussed in the contexts of breast, hepatic, lung, ovarian, lymphatic and thyroid cancers under in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this article, we focus on new natural spin-labelled derivatives such as camptothecin, rotenone, combretastatin, podophyllotoxin and others. The applications of nitroxides in the aging process, cardiovascular disease and pathological conditions were also discussed.},

Several different substitutions, such as hydrogen bonding formation substituent (OH) and ionic substituents (N(CH3)3+ and OSO3--), are presented at the 4-position of the spin probe, which leads to additional hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions between these substitutions and ionic liquids. The interactions in the systems of the radicals containing ionic substitutions with ionic liquids are predicted much stronger than those in the systems of neutral radicals, resulting in a significant reduction of the mobility of ionic radicals in ionic liquids. To further understand the nature of these interactions, the natural bond order, atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction index, electron density difference, energy decomposition analysis, and charge decomposition analysis schemes were employed. The additional ionic interactions between ionic radicals and counterions in ionic liquids are dominantly contributed from the electrostatic term, while the orbital interaction plays a major role in other interactions. The results reported herein are important to understand radical processes in ionic liquids and will be very useful in the design of task-specific ionic liquids to make the processes more efficient.},

	abstract = {Nitroxides, also known as nitroxyl radicals, are long-lived or stable radicals with the general structure R1R2N--O{$\bullet$}. The spin distribution over the nitroxide N and O atoms contributes to the thermodynamic stability of these radicals. The presence of bulky N-substituents R1 and R2 prevents nitroxide radical dimerization, ensuring their kinetic stability. Despite their reactivity toward various transient C radicals, some nitroxides can be easily stored under air at room temperature. Furthermore, nitroxides can be oxidized to oxoammonium salts (R1R2N=O+) or reduced to anions (R1R2N--O--), enabling them to act as valuable oxidants or reductants depending on their oxidation state. Therefore, they exhibit interesting reactivity across all three oxidation states. Due to these fascinating properties, nitroxides find extensive applications in diverse fields such as biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis. This review focuses on the versatile applications of nitroxides in organic synthesis. For their use in other important fields, we will refer to several review articles. The introductory part provides a brief overview of the history of nitroxide chemistry. Subsequently, the key methods for preparing nitroxides are discussed, followed by an examination of their structural diversity and physical properties. The main portion of this review is dedicated to oxidation reactions, wherein parent nitroxides or their corresponding oxoammonium salts serve as active species. It will be demonstrated that various functional groups (such as alcohols, amines, enolates, and alkanes among others) can be efficiently oxidized. These oxidations can be carried out using nitroxides as catalysts in combination with various stoichiometric terminal oxidants. By reducing nitroxides to their corresponding anions, they become effective reducing reagents with intriguing applications in organic synthesis. Nitroxides possess the ability to selectively react with transient radicals, making them useful for terminating radical cascade reactions by forming alkoxyamines. Depending on their structure, alkoxyamines exhibit weak C--O bonds, allowing for the thermal generation of C radicals through reversible C--O bond cleavage. Such thermally generated C radicals can participate in various radical transformations, as discussed toward the end of this review. Furthermore, the application of this strategy in natural product synthesis will be presented.},

This review provides an overview of advanced developed anode (Ti, Nb, carbon-based) and cathode (V-based and nitroxide radicals) materials and conductive polymer composite cathodes in rechargeable batteries in recent years and summarizes design strategies to achieve high-rate charging performance with long lifespans. The modified design strategies for overcoming the high-rate limitation of sluggish ion diffusion and low intrinsic conductivity mainly include surface coating, regulating morphology, creating defects, functionalizing group modification, chemical intercalating, and element doping. The development of charging protocols is also discussed.

In the last years, large efforts have been made regarding the investigation and development of batteries that use organic active materials since they feature superior properties compared to metal-based, in particular lithium-based, energy-storage systems in terms of flexibility and safety as well as with regard to resource availability and disposal. This Review compiles an overview over the most recent studies on the topic. It focuses on the different types of applied active materials, covering both known systems that are optimized and novel structures that aim at being established.},

	abstract = {Radical polymers are one of the redox polymers and bear robust radical molecules per repeating unit. Some of the radical polymers are characterized by the rapid and reversible one-electron redox ability of the radical sites. A typical example is poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy methacrylate), which has a very positive redox potential. The combination of the high density of radical redox sites and the amorphous plasticized state coexisting with a small quantity of electrolytes allows for a rapid self-exchange reaction among the sites driven by a steep concentration gradient, which leads to efficient charge transport and storage throughout the polymers. The chemical bistability of the reduced and oxidized species of radical polymers permits an ultimate energy density and durable cyclability during charging and discharging. Lithium-ion and all-organic batteries have thus been fabricated using radical polymers as electrode-active materials. The output voltage of the batteries is constant, corresponding to their redox potential difference, and can be tuned by the molecular design. The batteries provide burst power, which also allows instant full charging in a few seconds. The syntheses of radical polymers and various types of radical polymer batteries are described herein, with their future perspectives.},

The radicals in these polymers were robust at ambient conditions, and the polymers possessed radical densities of 2.97 {\texttimes} 1021, 4.27 {\texttimes} 1021, and 1.82 {\texttimes} 1021 unpaired electrons/g for 1-3, respectively, resulting in an electrode-active material with a high charge/discharge capacity. Particularly, the dinitroxide functional polymer 2 possessed the highest radical density. Cyclic voltammetry of the poly(nitroxylstyrene) 1 revealed a reversible redox at 0.74 V vs Ag/AgCl, which was assigned to the oxidation of the nitroxide radical to form the oxoammonium cation (p-type doped state). On the other hand, the poly(nitroxylstyrene) ortho-substituted with the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group 3 showed a reversible redox at -0.76 V, ascribed to the n-type redox pair between the nitroxide radical and the aminoxy anion. Thus, the nitroxide radical polymer could be switched from p-type material suitable for a cathode to n-type material (anode-active) via altering the electron-withdrawing character of the substituents on the poly(nitroxylstyrene). This is the first report of an n-type radical polymer and the first report of using substituent effects to switch the redox behavior of the polymer. This versatile switching ability enables these polymers to function as components of metal-free electrodes in rechargeable batteries.},

	abstract = {Radical stability has been subject to continuous research due to its importance in polymerization as well as in all-organic batteries. Recently, the SOMO--HOMO conversion was identified as the main factor in controlling the stability of distonic radicals, for which the negative charge resides on the same molecule. Based on this finding, the idea of ionic liquids stabilizing radicals was hypothesized in this study. A series of ionic liquids were tested in EPR measurements of the 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-1-oxyl. Unusually high rotational diffusion constants ({$\tau$}R), 4 times larger compared to conventional media such as dichloromethane (DCM), were recorded at room temperature. This finding could only be explained by a strong interaction existing between the radical and ionic liquid ions, which was confirmed with quantum chemical calculations, with interaction energies falling between -17.1 kJ mol-1 for tetramethylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate and -85.6 kJ mol-1 for 1,3-dimethylimidazolium triflate. Elevated temperature measurements performed at 80 {$^\circ$}C reduced the viscosity of the ionic liquids to that of DCM, while the {$\tau$}R values remained relatively high, thus further confirming that the rotational hindrance occurred due to radical--ionic liquid interactions. The calculated interaction energies between the radical and ionic liquids ions were also found to correlate well with experimental rotational diffusion constants, thus offering us a valuable tool in tailoring ionic liquids for enhanced stability of nitroxide radicals. The findings of this study showcase the ability of ionic liquids to reduce reactivity of nitroxides without the need for any chemical modification of the radical.},

The 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-yloxyl derivatives contain various substituents at the 4-position to the nitroxyl group, including hydrogen-bond-forming or ionic substituents that undergo additional interactions with the individual ions of the ionic liquids. Some of these spin probes contain similar ions to ionic liquids to avoid counter-ion exchange with the ionic liquid. Depending on the ionic liquid anion, the Stokes--Einstein theory or the Spernol--Gierer--Wirtz theory can be applied to describe the temperature dependence of the average rotational correlation time of the spin probe in the ionic liquids. Furthermore, the spin probes give information about the micropolarity of the ionic liquids. In this context the substituent at the 4-position to the nitroxyl group plays a significant role. Covalent bonding of a spin probe to the imidazolium ion results in bulky spin probes that are strongly immobilized in the ionic liquid. Furthermore, lophyl radical recombination in the dark, which is chosen to understand the dynamics of bimolecular reactions in ionic liquids, shows a slow process at longer timescale and a rise time at a shorter timescale. Although various reactions may contribute to the slower process during lophyl radical recombination, it follows a second-order kinetics that does not clearly show solvent viscosity dependence. However, the rise time, which may be attributed to radical pair formation, increases with increasing solvent viscosity.},

The MC simulation accounts for the dynamics of the associated solvent molecules.

The gas-phase ionization energy of ferrocene is calculated using the high-level composite method, G3(MP2)-RAD, and two higher-level variants of this method. These latter methods incorporate corrections for core correlation and, in the case of the highest level considered, use (RO)CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d,p) in place of (RO)CCSD(T)/6-31G(d) as the base level of theory. All methods provide good agreement with one another and the corresponding experimental values. Solvation energies have been calculated using PCM, CPCM, SMD, and COSMO-RS. Using G3(MP2)-RAD-Full-TZ gas-phase energies and COSMO-RS solvation energies, the absolute redox potentials of the Fc+/Fc couple have been calculated as 4.988, 4.927, and 5.043 V in acetonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane, and dimethylsulfoxide solutions, respectively.},

	abstract = {The redox potential is a powerful thermodynamic and kinetic tool used to predict numerous chemical and biochemical mechanisms. However, despite the improving predictive power of density functional theory (DFT), chemically accurate theoretical redox potentials are often difficult to achieve with DFT. For example, calculated redox potentials are sensitive to density functional choice and often fall short of the desired accuracy. Thus, ranges of errors for computed redox potentials between different density functionals can become quite large. The current study presents a cost-effective protocol that utilizes effective error cancellation schemes in order to accurately predict the redox potentials of a wide range of organic molecules. This computational protocol, called CBH-Redox, is an extension of the connectivity-based hierarchy (CBH) method, and produces thermochemical data with near-G4 accuracy. Herein, we test the CBH-Redox protocol against both experimental and G4 reference values and compare these results to DFT alone. Considering 46 C, O, N, F, Cl, and S atom-containing molecules, when using the CBH-Redox correction scheme, the MAEs for all eight density functionals tested are within the 0.09 V target accuracy versus both experiment and G4. Moreover, CBH-Redox achieves an impressive accuracy, with a MAE of 0.05 V or below when compared to G4 for six of the eight density functionals tested. In addition, when the CBH correction is applied, the error range across all functionals tested decreases from 0.12 V to about 0.05 V versus G4, and from 0.13 V to 0.04 V versus experiment.},

The structures of the ion--aromatic-ring complexes are the result of an interaction between the large quadrupole moment of the ring and the charge of the ion. Four attractive interaction types are proposed to be distinguished based on the position of the ion with respect to the plane of the ring: perpendicular cation--{$\pi$} (CP{$\perp$}), co-planar cation--{$\pi$} (CP{$\parallel$}), perpendicular anion--{$\pi$} (AP{$\perp$}), and co-planar anion--{$\pi$} (AP{$\parallel$}). To understand more than the basic features of these four interaction types, a systematic, high-level quantum chemical study is performed, using the X-- + C6H6, M+ + C6H6, X-- + C6F6, and M+ + C6F6 model systems with X- = H-, F-, Cl-, HCOO-, CH3COO- and M+ = H+, Li+, Na+, , CH3 , whereby C6H6 and C6F6 represent an electron-rich and an electron-deficient {$\pi$} system, respectively. Benchmark-quality interaction energies with small uncertainties, obtained via the so-called focal-point analysis (FPA) technique, are reported for the four interaction types. The computations reveal that the interactions lead to significant stabilization, and that the interaction energy order, given in kcal mol-1 in parentheses, is CP{$\perp$} (23--37) {$>$} AP{$\perp$} (14--21) {$>$} CP{$\parallel$} (9--22) {$>$} AP{$\parallel$} (6--16). A natural bond orbital analysis performed leads to a deeper qualitative understanding of the four interaction types. To facilitate the future quantum chemical characterization of ion--aromatic-ring interactions in large biomolecules, the performance of three density functional theory methods, B3LYP, BHandHLYP, and M06-2X, is tested against the FPA benchmarks, with the result that the M06-2X functional performs best. {\copyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Temperature, as a critical factor, significantly impacts on the performance of lithium-ion batteries and also limits the application of lithium-ion batteries.

Accurate measurement of temperature inside lithium-ion batteries and understanding the temperature effects are important for the proper battery management.

In this work, we present a fragment-based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation of sodium halide solution droplet (in a neutral mixture of Na+, F--, Cl--, and Br-- ions) at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level. We show that the studied halide ions exhibit surface preference in the order (F-- {$<$} Cl-- {$<$} Br--) which is in accordance with the experimental observation. The resulting potential of mean force (PMF) for Br-- produces a distinct minimum at the water/air interface, while the minimum of the PMF for F-- appears in the bulk region. The ion-pairing interactions between halide anions and Na+ cations are characterized, and it reveals that the specific solvent-separated ion pairs (SIPs) are more preferred than the direct contact ion pairs (CIPs). The transition between different types of SIPs is observed. Other structural and dynamical properties of ions and ion-hydration shells are investigated. These results provide broader and new physical insights for understanding the ion-specific behavior in interfacial solvation at the atomistic level.},

The liquid electrolyte is one of the most important parts of a battery and is extremely critical in stabilizing the electrode--electrolyte interfaces and constructing safe and long-life-span batteries. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing new electrolyte solvents, salts, additives, and recipes, where molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an increasingly important role in exploring electrolyte structures, physicochemical properties such as ionic conductivity, and interfacial reaction mechanisms. This review affords an overview of applying MD simulations in the study of liquid electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. First, the fundamentals and recent theoretical progress in three-class MD simulations are summarized, including classical, ab initio, and machine-learning MD simulations (section 2). Next, the application of MD simulations to the exploration of liquid electrolytes, including probing bulk and interfacial structures (section 3), deriving macroscopic properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant of electrolytes (section 4), and revealing the electrode--electrolyte interfacial reaction mechanisms (section 5), are sequentially presented. Finally, a general conclusion and an insightful perspective on current challenges and future directions in applying MD simulations to liquid electrolytes are provided. Machine-learning technologies are highlighted to figure out these challenging issues facing MD simulations and electrolyte research and promote the rational design of advanced electrolytes for next-generation rechargeable batteries.},

The TFSI- ions prefer to stay in the second solvation shell and beyond. Meanwhile, the comparable diffusion coefficients of positive and negative ions in Mg(TFSI)2 aqueous electrolytes have been observed, which is mainly due to the formation of the stable [Mg(H2O)6]2+ complex, and, as a result, the increased effective Mg ion size. Finally, the calculated correlated transference numbers are lower than the uncorrelated ones even at the low concentration of 2 and 3 m, suggesting the enhanced correlations between ions in the multivalent electrolytes.

	abstract = {Nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries are an intensively studied future energy storage technology because of their high theoretical energy density. However, a number of barriers prevent a practical application, and one of the major challenges is the reduction of the high charge overpotential: Whereas lithium peroxide (Li2O2) is formed during discharge at around 2.7 V (vs Li+/Li), its electrochemical decomposition during the charge process requires potentials up to 4.5 V. This high potential gap leads to a low round-trip efficiency of the cell, and more importantly, the high charge potential causes electrochemical decomposition of other cell constituents. Dissolved oxidation catalysts can act as mobile redox mediators (RM), which enable the oxidation of Li2O2 particles even without a direct electric contact to the positive electrode. Herein we show that the addition of 10 mM TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl), homogeneously dissolved in the electrolyte, provides a distinct reduction of the charging potentials by 500 mV. Moreover, TEMPO enables a significant enhancement of the cycling stability leading to a doubling of the cycle life. The efficiency of the TEMPO mediated catalysis was further investigated by a parallel monitoring of the cell pressure, which excludes a considerable contribution of a parasitic shuttle (i.e., internal ionic short circuit) to the anode during cycling. We prove the suitability of TEMPO by a systematic study of the relevant physical and chemical properties, i.e., its (electro)chemical stability, redox potential, diffusion coefficient and the influence on the oxygen solubility. Furthermore, the charging mechanisms of Li-O2 cells with and without TEMPO were compared by combining different electrochemical and analytical techniques.},

Each RTIL is composed of tetrafluoroborate (BF4) anion and dialkylimidazolium (MMIM) cations. The first alkyl group of MIM is methyl, and the other group is ethyl (EMIM), butyl (BMIM), hexyl (HMIM), octyl (OMIM), and decyl (DMIM). Upon addition of ACN, the ionic conductivity of RTILs increases by more than 50 times. It significantly exceeds an impact of most known solvents. Unexpectedly, long-tailed imidazolium cations demonstrate the sharpest conductivity boost. This finding motivates us to revisit an application of RTIL/ACN binary systems as advanced electrolyte solutions. The conductivity correlates with a composition of ion aggregates simplifying its predictability. Addition of ACN exponentially increases diffusion and decreases viscosity of the RTIL/ACN mixtures. Large amounts of ACN stabilize ion pairs, although they ruin greater ion aggregates.},

The impact of the presence of the counteranion on the solvation of Li+ in pure propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate was also studied. The calculations revealed small free-energy changes for the transitions between different preferred structures in mixed solvents. This implies that transitions between distinct local arrangements can take place in the mixtures. The addition of dimethyl carbonate causes a significant increase of the dipole moment of solvation clusters, indicating important molecular-scale modifications when dimethyl carbonate is used as a co-solvent. The presence of an anion in the solvation shell of Li+ modifies the intermolecular structure comprising four carbonate molecules in dilute solutions, allowing only two carbonate molecules to coordinate to Li+. The bidentate complexation of Li+ with the anion's electron donor atoms, however, maintains the local tetrahedral structure on interatomic length scales. The neutralization of the solvation shell of Li+ due to contact ion pair formation and the consequent implications on the underlying mechanisms provide a rational explanation for the ionic conductivity drop of electrolyte solutions at high salt concentrations.},

Through comprehensive calculations using both first-principles as well as well-benchmarked classical molecular dynamics over a matrix of electrolytes, covering solvents and salt anions with a broad range in chemistry, we elucidate systematic correlations between molecular level interactions and composite electrolyte properties, such as electrochemical stability, solvation structure, and dynamics. We find that Mg electrolytes are highly prone to ion pair formation, even at modest concentrations, for a wide range of solvents with different dielectric constants, which have implications for dynamics as well as charge transfer. Specifically, we observe that, at Mg metal potentials, the ion pair undergoes partial reduction at the Mg cation center (Mg2+ {$\rightarrow$} Mg+), which competes with the charge transfer mechanism and can activate the anion to render it susceptible to decomposition. Specifically, TFSI-- exhibits a significant bond weakening while paired with the transient, partially reduced Mg+. In contrast, BH4-- and BF4-- are shown to be chemically stable in a reduced ion pair configuration. Furthermore, we observe that higher order glymes as well as DMSO improve the solubility of Mg salts, but only the longer glyme chains reduce the dynamics of the ions in solution. This information provides critical design metrics for future electrolytes as it elucidates a close connection between bulk solvation and cathodic stability as well as the dynamics of the salt.},

	abstract = {The 1:1 ion pair formation constants (KIP0) of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ([RMeIm]+; R = butyl, hexyl, and octyl) and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium ([BuMe2Im]+) ions with tetrafluoroborate ([BF4]-), hexafluorophosphate ([PF6]-), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([NTf2]-), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate (picrate, [Pic]-) ions have been determined conductometrically in dichloromethane at 25 {$^\circ$}C. The KIP0 determinations have also been made for symmetric tetraalkylammonium ions ([R4N]+; R = methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl) for comparison. For a given anion, the KIP0 value of the [RMeIm]+ salt is almost independent of the length of the alkyl chain (R), whereas that of the [R4N]+ salt decreases with increasing alkyl chain length. Such a difference in the alkyl chain length dependence of the ion pair formation ability can be explained on the basis of the structures of the ion pairs calculated by density functional theory. The KIP0 values of [BuMeIm]+, [BuMe2Im]+, and [Et4N]+, which are similar in the van der Waals volume, are in the order of [BuMeIm]+ {$\gg$} [BuMe2Im]+ {$\approx$} [Et4N]+, showing that the C2-H atom on the imidazolium ring makes an important contribution to the strong ion pair formation ability of [RMeIm]+. For a given cation, the KIP0 value is generally smaller for the larger anion, i.e., [BF4]- {$\geq$} [PF6]- {$\geq$} [NTf2]- {$>$} [Pic]- for [Et4N]+ and [BuMe2Im]+, and [BF4]- {$>$} [PF6]- {$\geq$} [Pic]- {$\geq$} [NTf2]- for [RMeIm]+.},

	abstract = {Lithium-sulfur (LiS) batteries are emanating as the next generation alternatives for rechargeable batteries. However, the loss of capacity and self-discharge due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides hinders their practical applications. In this study, we performed density functional theory simulations to explore the importance of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as possible anchoring channels to immobilize soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2S2n, where n~=~2,3, and 4). We quantitatively investigated the interplay between confinement effects and interaction energy of Li2S2n species with CNT to address the shuttling effect. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between CNTs and lithium polysulfides is governed by electrostatic interactions. Based on the interaction energies, Charge transfer analysis, and density of states, we found that CNTs facilitate the immobilization of Li2S2n. Results obtained from this study will provide useful guidelines to improve the performance of LiS batteries.},

Speciation profiles obtained by potentiometric titrations in aqueous solution (i.e., 0.16~M NaCl), and supported by UV--Vis data, show that a complexation occurs at 1:1 and 1:2 Fe(III)-to-ligand ratios and at 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 Cu(II)-to-ligand ratios. The most plausible structures were firstly hypothesized by considering a general equilibrium that considers the effective ligands which enter in the coordination sphere of the metal ions: the anionic forms of ascorbic acid and hydroxide ion. Computational tools were, thus, exploited to ascertain the feasibility of the hypothesized complexes formation.},

DFT calculations and Monte Carlo simulation are applied to further explain the anti-corrosion mechanism. Quantum chemical indexes, are performed using DFT/B3LYP methods with SDD, 6-31++G (d,p) and 6-31 G basis sets in gas and aqueous phase. The inhibitors can be adsorbed onto surfaces by both physical and chemical means obeys Langmuir and that of El-Awady adsorption isotherm. Potentiodynamic polarization curves revealed that AATRs behave as mixed-type inhibitors. Both thermodynamic and kinetic: (Kads, ∆G{$^\circ$}ads, A, 1/y, Ea, ∆H{$^\circ$}a and ∆S{$^\circ$}a) parameters were determined and discussed. The adsorption behaviour of the AATR derivatives on Cu (111) surface was investigated by Monte Carlo simulation in the presence of water to verify their corrosion inhibition efficacies. The results showed that AATRs were good inhibitors and the inhibition efficiency increased with increasing of their concentration but decreased with rising temperature. The high IE (\%) is due primarily to the adsorption behaviour of both free ligand inhibitor, together with overlapping chelate [Cu (I) and Cu (II)-AATR] complex molecules in the ratio (1:1) and/or (1:2) depending on concentration. DFT calculations and Monte Carlo simulation indicate that the order of IE (\%) is: AATR\_3{$\cong$}AATR\_2{$>$}AATR\_1. The theoretical results were found to be consistent with the experimental data reported.},

Geometrical optimization and free energy calculations in gas and solvated states have been performed. In addition to single-electron redox reactions, dissociations joined with these reductions and oxidations were investigated. While the anodic limit was determined by anions oxidation potential, a range of various reactions governed the cathodic bound. Ammonium, and phosphonium-based cations probably tended to reduce directly yet arsenium based cation family most likely underwent decomposition during the reduction. Highest occupied- Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO --LUMO) energies and iso-surfaces, as well as the bond length and energies and natural bond orbital analysis, were used to confirm the idea.},

	abstract = {Fe[(H2O)6]3+ and Fe[(H2O)6]2+ are the two stable forms of iron aqua complexes with six water molecules surrounding a central metal. In aqueous media, these complexes undergo hydrolysis reactions. Previous DFT studies of this reaction have focused predominantly on single point calculations and geometry optimization. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the dynamical behavior of molecules during this reaction. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic reaction of both iron aqua complexes. To investigate the behavior of complexes in this regard, DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations were conducted. Prior to any calculation, the multiplicity corresponding to the stable form and the frontier orbital (LUMO) of each complex were determined. The complex is simulated dynamically in the presence of two distinct molecules: water and a negative ion. Two negative ions with distinct nucleophilicity were considered: Cl- and OH-. Each complex exhibited no reaction with the water molecule. Conversely, both complexes interacted with both negative ions and subsequently, two molecules of HCl and a reduced complex are produced during this reaction. In an aqueous medium, the HCl molecule dissociated to produce hydronium and chloride ions. Additionally, simulations of the reactions between the produced complex and negative ions were performed. Each negative ion hydrolyzed each complex to a certain extent. This investigation has revealed that the negative ion (except OH-) is a spectator ion in the series of hydrolysis reactions. In addition, the presence of more nucleophilic negative ions has led to the inclusion of additional steps to the hydrolysis reaction.},

Quantum chemical modeling is helpful to know about the arrangement (adsorption) of benzethonium chloride on the electrode surface. The electrochemical behavior of the BzTCMCPE was explained using frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and analytical Fukui functions.},
