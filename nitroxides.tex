\section{Introduction}


The quest for efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions has intensified research into various battery chemistries. Among these, nitroxide-based batteries have attracted, since their first application in 2002 \cite{nakaharaRechargeableBatteriesOrganic2002}, significant attention due to their high theoretical capacity \cite{friebeSustainableEnergyStorage2019,ernouldNitroxidesBatteryrelatedApplications2021,keDesigningStrategiesAdvanced2023}. They are generally found, like other radical polymers, as a cathode material \cite{okaRadicalPolymersRechargeable2020a,assummaNewConductingCopolymer2020}. Beyond their application in batteries, nitroxides have been extensively studied and utilized in various fields. They serve as spin labels in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy \cite{torricellaNitroxideSpinLabels2021}, as mediators for organic radical reactions and polymerizations \cite{tebbenNitroxidesApplicationsSynthesis2011,leifertOrganicSynthesisUsing2023}, in organic electronic devices \cite{jiAirStableOrganicRadicals2020,xieNitroxideRadicalPolymers2021}, and as antioxidants in biological systems  \cite{souleChemistryBiologyNitroxide2007,lewandowskiNitroxidesAntioxidantsAnticancer2017,prescottBiologicalRelevanceFree2017}.

Nitroxides are organic compounds containing the nitroxyl/aminoxyl radical functional group \cite{berlinerHistoryUseNitroxides2012}. This group can exist in three redox states: the nitroxide radical ($>$\ce{N-O^.}, also shortened in \ce{N^.} in this article), which can be oxidized to the oxoammonium cation ($>$\ce{N+=O}, abbreviated \ce{N+}) or reduced to the hydroxylamine anion ($>$\ce{N-O-}, abbreviated \ce{N-}), as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:states}. The remarkable stability of the nitroxide radical arises from the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, combined with the steric protection provided by the substituents, and environmental effects due to the interaction with solvent and ions \cite{grynovaOriginScopeLongRange2013,grynovaSwitchingRadicalStability2013}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{Figure1}
	\caption{Oxidized (left) and reduced (right) forms of the the nitroxide radical (center).}
	\label{fig:states}
\end{figure}

Experimental studies have demonstrated that the performance of nitroxide-based batteries is influenced by substituents \cite{sugaCathodeAnodeActivePoly2007}, solvation, and the nature of the electrolytes used \cite{armandIonicliquidMaterialsElectrochemical2009,strehmelRadicalsIonicLiquids2012,wylieIncreasedStabilityNitroxide2019b}. Understanding the interplay between nitroxides, solvents, and electrolytes is therefore crucial for the rational design of high-performance batteries. Computational studies using quantum chemical methods provide valuable insights into solvation effects, enabling the prediction and tuning of redox properties.

From a phenomenological perspective, two approaches can be used: at low concentrations in electrolytes, the Debye-HÃ¼ckel (DH) theory \cite{kontogeorgisDebyeHuckelTheoryIts2018,silvaDerivationsDebyeHuckel2022,silvaImprovingBornEquation2024} provides an initial estimate for interactions within an ionic liquid. While improvements have been proposed over the years to better account for ion-solvent interactions, particularly by including dipole-ion \cite{silvaImprovingBornEquation2024} and quadrupole-ion interactions \cite{slavchovQuadrupoleTermsMaxwell2014,slavchovQuadrupoleTermsMaxwell2014a,coxQuadrupolemediatedDielectricResponse2021}, there have been only a few attempts \cite{matsuiDensityFunctionalTheory2013,xiaoReorganizationEnergyElectron2013,xiaoMolecularDebyeHuckelApproach2014} to incorporate DH theory into the prediction of redox potentials. There is also a limited implementation of DH theory in the polarizable continuum model \cite{cossiInitioStudyIonic1998}. 

At high concentrations (such as in ionic liquids), ion-pair formation can be expected \cite{marcusIonPairing2006}. Alongside electrostatic models \cite{krishtalikElectrostaticIonSolvent1991,lundDielectricInterpretationSpecificity2010}, various theoretical calculations of redox potentials have been performed \cite{mehtaTheoreticalInvestigationRedox2007,quAccurateModelingEffect2016,taherkhaniInvestigationIonPairs2022}, indicating that such interactions can be significant. This has also been recently investigated experimentally by Mugisa et al. \cite{mugisaEffectIonparingKinetics2024}, who assessed the impact of complexation on the redox potential and kinetics of charged metal complexes.

Therefore, while seminal studies by Coote and co-workers \cite{hodgsonOneElectronOxidationReduction2007,blincoExperimentalTheoreticalStudies2008} have focused on the impact of substituents on the redox potential of nitroxides, later investigations by other groups have also considered the impact of electrolytes and the various interactions between them, including electrostatic interactions. For example, in 2019, Wylie and co-workers \cite{wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a,wylieIncreasedStabilityNitroxide2019b} demonstrated that interactions between the ionic liquid and nitroxide can increase the redox potential by more than \SI{3}{\volt} with a well-chosen pair of electrolytes. Prior to this, Zhang \textit{et al.} focused on stabilizing radical-ion interactions \cite{zhangInteractionsImidazoliumBasedIonic2016,zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}, showing that interactions between a cation and the nitroxyl group are driven by both electrostatic and dispersion effects.


In this study, the impact of solvation at low and high concentrations in electrolytes on the redox potential of various nitroxides is investigated. Since the impact of different electrolytes has already been addressed, the focus is on the effects of the skeleton bearing the nitroxyl group, categorized into five families (Fig.~\ref{fig:families}), and the substituents. To facilitate comparison with experimental data, two solvents are considered: water and acetonitrile, for which experimental results are available \cite{morrisChemicalElectrochemicalReduction1991,goldsteinStructureActivityRelationship2006,blincoExperimentalTheoreticalStudies2008,zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}. Different (semi-)quantitative models are employed at each step to aid in the interpretation of the results.

This paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:theory} introduces key concepts and models. The methodology used in this study is detailed in Section \ref{sec:methodo}. The results are then presented in four parts: the impact of substituents on the redox properties is discussed in Section \ref{sec:sar}, followed by an analysis of the effects of solvents in Section \ref{sec:solv}, and the influence of electrolytes in Section \ref{sec:elect}. Finally, a comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results is provided in Section \ref{sec:exp}. Conclusions and future outlooks are presented in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{Redox potentials in solution}

According to Ref.~\cite{marenichComputationalElectrochemistryPrediction2014}, the absolute reduction potential $E_{abs}^0$ (in \si{\volt}) of the half-reaction of reduction of $X^z$, $X^{z} + n_e\,e^- \rightarrow X^{z-n_e}$, reads: \begin{equation}
	E_{abs}^0(X^{z}|X^{z-n_e}) = -\frac{\Delta G_{r}^\star}{n_e\,F}, \text{ with } \Delta G_{r}^\star = G^\star(X^{z-n_e}) - G^\star(X^z), \label{eq:nernst}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta G_{r}^\star$ is the free Gibbs energy of the reduction reaction in solution, $F$ is the Faraday constant (\SI{9.648533e4}{\coulomb\per\mole}) and $n_e$ the number of electrons involved in the reduction process. Last but not least, $G^\star(X^z)$ is the Gibbs free energy of $X^z$ in solution.  In the rest of this article, it is considered that $G^\star(e^-) = 0$.

While there is some validity in using the adiabatic ionization/electron affinity potentials instead of the full Gibbs free energy change when the reorganization energy (in the sense of Marcus theory, referring to the geometry relaxation between two redox states) is small, allowing for precise post-Hartree Fock methods to be utilized \cite{namazianBenchmarkCalculationsAbsolute2010,marenichComputationalElectrochemistryPrediction2014,makosModelingAbsoluteRedox2022}, this condition is not met in the present study, which would require to evaluate geometry reorganization and solvent effects at a different level. Consequently, a coherent treatment at the DFT level is chosen for this article.


The comparison between relative (vs SHE) experimental and calculated oxidation potential is performed using a common reference:\begin{equation}
	E^0_{rel}(X^z|X^{z-n_e})  = E^0_{abs}(X^z|X^{z-n_e}) - E^{0}_{abs}(\text{SHE}), \label{eq:ecalc}
\end{equation}
with $E^0_{abs}(\text{SHE}) = \SI{4.28}{\volt}$ in water or \SI{4.52}{\volt} in acetonitrile \cite{marenichComputationalElectrochemistryPrediction2014}.


\subsection{Debye-Huckel theory}

From a phenomenological perspective, such $G^\star(X^z)$ values are the sum of the system's energy in vacuum, $G^0(X^z)$, and the change in (free) energy resulting from its transfer to an electrolytic solution, $\Delta G_S^\star(X^z)$. The latter can be further decomposed using the thermodynamic cycle presented in Figure \ref{fig:th}. There are four steps: $\Delta G_d + \Delta G_s$ (discharge of a sphere in the gas phase followed by charging in a dielectric) constitutes a purely electrostatic process, while $\Delta G_s$ is primarily due to non-electrostatic contributions (cavitation, van der Waals forces, etc.). Finally, $\Delta G^\star_{DH}$ incorporates the effect of surrounding ions and is therefore crucial for treating electrolytes \cite{silvaImprovingBornEquation2024}.

	\caption{Thermodynamic cycle to compute the energy of solvatation of an ion, $X^z$, in a electrolyte (solvent characterized by a $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0\,\varepsilon_r$ dielectric constant and by a ``cloud'' of other ions). $\Delta G_d$ is the discharge of $X^z$ in gas phase, $\Delta G_s$ is the solvatation of $X$, $\Delta G_c$ is the charging of $X$ in $\varepsilon$, and $\Delta G^\star_{DH}$ is the addition of the other ions.}
	\label{fig:th}
\end{figure}


On the one hand, at the quantum chemistry (QC) level, the solvatation energy is generally treated implicitly, thanks to a self-consistent reaction field approach (SCRF) \cite{herbertDielectricContinuumMethods2021}: \begin{align}
	G^\star_{SCRF}(X) &= \Braket{\Psi|{\hat{H}+\frac{1}{2}\hat{R}}|\Psi} + G_{th}[\Psi] + G_{nonelst}(X) \nonumber\\
	&= E[\Psi] + G_{th}[\Psi] + \underbrace{G_{elst}[\Psi] + G_{nonelst}(X)}_{\Delta G^\star_{S,SCRF}(X)}, \label{eq:scrf}
\end{align}
where $\Psi$ is the wavefunction of $X$ (minimized under the application of $\hat R$, so not equal to the gas phase wavefunction), $\hat H$ is the electronic Hamiltonian, $\hat R$ is the reaction field operator (generally recognized to give rise to the electrostatic contribution to the solvation energy, $G_{elst}$), $G_{th}$ are the thermal contributions to the Gibbs free energy derived from thermostatistic analysis, and $G_{nonelst}$ is the non-electrostatic contributions (cavitation, dispersion, etc) to the solvation energy. Therefore, using the notation of Figure \ref{fig:th} (and assuming no change in the geometry of $X^z$), $ \Delta G^\star_{S,SCRF}(X^z) = \Delta G_d + \Delta G_s + \Delta G_{c}$.  

On the other hand, the Debye-Huckel (DH) theory provide another estimate of $\Delta G_{S}^\star$ \cite{bockrisModernElectrochemistryIonics1998}. Indeed, assuming that a ion $X^z$, bearing a charge $q = z\,e_0$ ($e_0$ is the elementary charge), can be approximated by a sphere of radius $a$ and that the ions in the solution are distributed in the solution according to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, one obtains the corresponding solvation energy as \cite{kontogeorgisDebyeHuckelTheoryIts2018,silvaDerivationsDebyeHuckel2022,silvaImprovingBornEquation2024}:\begin{align}
	\Delta G^\star_{S,DH}(X^z)
	&= \Delta G^\star_{born}(X^z) + \Delta G^\star_{DH}(X^z)\label{eq:adh}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta G^\star_{Born}(X^z) =\frac{q^2}{8\pi\varepsilon_0\,a}\,\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}-1\right], \label{eq:born}\\
\end{equation}
and,
\begin{align}
	&\Delta G^\star_{DH}(X^z) = -\frac{q^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}\,\frac{\kappa}{(\kappa\,a)^3}\,\left[\ln(1+\kappa\,a)-\kappa\,a+\frac{1}{2}(\kappa\,a)^2\right],\label{eq:dh} \end{align}
in which $\kappa$ is the inverse of the Debye screening length, defined from:\begin{equation}
	\kappa^2 = \sum_i \frac{n_i\,q_i^2}{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r\,k_B\,T}, \label{eq:kappa2}
\end{equation}
where $n_i$ is the number density ($n_i = N_i / V = c_i\,\mathcal{N}_a$ where $\mathcal{N}_a$ is the Avogadro number and $c_i$ is the concentration in ion $i$) of ion of type $i$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant (\SI{1.380649e-23}{\joule\per\kelvin}), and $T$ is the temperature (assumed to be \SI{298.15}{\kelvin}).  $\kappa$ is  proportional to the ionic strength of the solution, $I = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i c_i\,z_i^2$.  The Born part is generally dominant in solvatation energies predicted by this model (Fig.~S1).

In the limit of $\kappa\to 0$,  $\Delta G^\star_{DH} = 0$ and thus $\Delta G^\star_S \approx \Delta G^\star_{born} = \Delta G_d + \Delta G_c$.  Therefore, by combining Eqs.~\eqref{eq:scrf} and \eqref{eq:adh}, one defines:\begin{equation}
	G^\star(X^z) = G^\star_{SCRF}(X^z) + \Delta G^\star_{DH}(X^z), \label{eq:gtot}
\end{equation}
to be used in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nernst}.

\subsection{Model for the impact of the substituent}\label{sec:eleczhang}

In a first approximation, the electrostatic interaction between the substituent(s) and the charge formed upon oxidation or reduction influences the redox potential of nitroxides. Specifically, assuming a non-charged substituent, charge-dipole interactions stabilize the oxoammonium ($>$\ce{N+=O}) if the dipole is aligned with the charge, while they destabilize the hydroxylamine ($>$\ce{N-O-}), both resulting in a decrease in the redox potential (see Fig.~\ref{fig:dipole}). Within this framework, it is therefore expected that compounds with donor substituents have lower redox potentials than acceptor substituents.


\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figure4}
	\caption{Impact of the dipole orientation of the substituent on the redox potential when the dipole is oriented in  the positive $x$ direction (red) or not (blue). Adapted from Ref.~\citenum{zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}.}
	\label{fig:dipole}
\end{figure}

In 2018, building upon previous work by Gryn'ova and co-workers \cite{grynovaOriginScopeLongRange2013,grynovaSwitchingRadicalStability2013}, Zhang \textit{et al.} extended and applied this model to the oxidation potential of nitroxides \cite{zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}. They further expanded the electrostatic interaction as multipoles, truncated after the third order, to incorporate the large quadrupole moment of aromatic compounds:
\begin{equation}
	U_q(r) =\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \left[\frac{\mu_x}{r^2} + \frac{Q_{xx}}{r^3}\right], \label{eq:Er}
\end{equation}
assuming a non-charged substituent. The different quantities (dipole moment, $\mu_x$, and traceless quadrupole moment, $Q_{xx}$) are evaluated through a single-point calculation on a simplified structure, using the geometry of the radical where the \ce{N-O^.} moiety is substituted by \ce{CH2}. In this article, since the alignment of the dipole with the charge needs to be accounted for, this geometry is oriented such that the $x$-axis passes through the origin and the nitrogen, with the origin placed at the carbon bearing the substituent. This definition differs from the original model, as Zhang and co-workers did not consider multiple positions for a given substituent. They also only focused on the oxidation, while both redox process are considered here.


\subsection{Impact of ion-pair formation on redox potentials}

At high concentrations of electrolyte, the formation of ion pairs in solution is expected (further insights are provided in the subsequent subsection). In this study, the electrolyte consists of a pair, \ce{AC}, of counterions, where \ce{A-} and \ce{C+} represent the anion and cation, respectively. Furthermore, two states of complexation are considered: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the pairs \ce{NA}, \ce{NC^.+}, and \ce{NC} between the oxidized, neutral and reduced states of the nitroxide  (with a complexation equilibrium constant $K_{x1}$), with their corresponding counterions (\ce{A-} and \ce{C+}, respectively), and then
	\item complexation with the \ce{AC} pair (with an equilibrium constant $K_{x2}$), which occurs when the concentration of electrolyte becomes large \cite{wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a}.
\end{inparaenum}
The various equilibrium constants are defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:cip}. Note that only the complexation between the radical species and the cation is considered here, according to previous investigations by Zhang \textit{et al.} \cite{zhangInteractionsImidazoliumBasedIonic2016,zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}.

	\label{fig:cip}
\end{figure}

Following Mugisa and co-workers \cite{mugisaEffectIonparingKinetics2024}, a quantitative model is derived from Fig.~\ref{fig:cip}, owing that: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the total concentration of redox-active species is given by $c_{ox} = [\ce{N+}] + [\ce{NA}] + [\ce{NAC+}]$, $c_{rad} = [\ce{N^.}] + [\ce{NAC^.}]$, and $c_{red} =  [\ce{N-}] + [\ce{NC}] + [\ce{NAC-}]$,
	\item due to electroneutrality, $ [\ce{C+}] = [\ce{A-}] $,
	\item the electrolyte is present in large amounts compared to redox-active species, hence $[X] = [\ce{C+}] = [\ce{A-}] $ is constant ($[X]$ represents the electrolyte concentration),
	\item at the equilibrium of redox reactions, $c_{ox} = c_{rad}$ ($K_1$) and $c_{red} = c_{rad}$ ($K_2$), and
	\item the redox potentials of the ion-pair complexes are smaller than the one of the free species.
\end{inparaenum}
Within these assumption, the following electrolyte concentration-dependent (formal) redox potentials are obtained:\begin{align}
	E^f_{abs}(\ce{N+|N^.}) &= E^0_ {abs}(\ce{N+|N^.})+\frac{RT}{F}\,\ln\left[\frac{1+K_{11}\,[X]+K_{12}\,[X]^2}{1+K_{01}\,[X]+K_{02}\,[X]^2}\right],\\
	E^f_{abs}(\ce{N^.|N-}) &= E^0_ {abs}(\ce{N^.|N-})+\frac{RT}{F}\,\ln\left[\frac{1+K_{21}\,[X]+K_{22}\,[X]^2}{1+K_{11}\,[X]+K_{12}\,[X]^2}\right],
\end{align}
in which $K_{ij}= \exp\left[-\frac{\Delta G_{cplx}^\star}{RT}\right]$, where $\Delta G_{cplx}^\star$ is the free Gibbs energy change [computed with Eq.~\eqref{eq:gtot}] for a given complexation reaction.

An example is provided in Fig.~S2: to have a significant impact, two conditions must be met: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the complexation constant must be large, and
	\item there must be a substantial difference between the complexation energies of the two species in the redox couple.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Model for the ion-pair formation}

Insight into the formation of ion pairs ($K_{01}$ and $K_{21}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:cip}) is provided by a simple model proposed by Lund et al. \cite{lundDielectricInterpretationSpecificity2010}. It is based on the balance between the solvation of the individual charges (described by the Born model, Eq.~\eqref{eq:born}) and the formation of a dipole when the two charges interact, leading to the famous Onsager model \cite{onsagerElectricMomentsMolecules1936,krishtalikElectrostaticIonSolvent1991,aubretUnderstandingLocalField2019}. From the thermodynamic cycle given in Fig.~\ref{fig:ionpair}, one can derive the following expression: \begin{equation}

where $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a=s_2\,( a_1^3+a_2^3)^{1/3}$ are the radii of the cavities corresponding to $q_1$, $q_2$, and the dipole, respectively, defined as $\mu = \frac{s_1}{2}\,|q_2-q_1|\,(a_1+a_2)$.  $s_1$ and $s_2$ are scaling factors, which account for the electrostatic attraction between the two charges forming the dipole ($s_1\leq 1$) and the fact that the cavity might not be spherical ($s_2\geq 1$).

	\label{fig:ionpair}
\end{figure}

This qualitative model (see Fig.~S3) indicates that ion pairing depends on: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item the ratio $\chi = a_1 / a_2$, with $\chi \sim 1$ leading to the lowest pair formation energy (as previously noted by Lund and colleagues),
	\item the attraction between the charges ($s_1$),
	\item the shape of the final cavity (pairing energy increases with $s_2$), and
	\item the dielectric constant $\varepsilon_r$.
\end{inparaenum}
While the latter parameter has only a minor influence (although the difference increases with $s_1$), the formation of a pair of ions is favored in less polar solvents, as expected.

It is worth noting that the impact of the ratio between the radii of different species has been observed by other researchers. For instance, Wylie and co-workers reported in Ref.~\citenum{wylieIncreasedStabilityNitroxide2019b} that the stabilization of the cation-radical pair, \ce{NC^.}, by the anion is inversely proportional to the size of the latter. However, it should also be noted that the Debye-HÃ¼ckel (DH) correction presented above tends to favor individual ions (which are more stabilized at high $[X]$ due to the increase of $\kappa$) rather than large,and generally neutral, complexes.


\subsection{Counterion as a fictitious particle}

Alternatively, Matsui et al. \cite{matsuiDensityFunctionalTheory2013} proposed that the impact of counterions on the redox potential of $X^z$ could be described using a single fictitious particle, $P^{-z}$, with a radius $a=fa_0$ proportional to that of the redox species, $a_0$ (considered constant for all oxidation states of $X$), and bearing the appropriate counter-charge, $-z$. They suggested evaluating the energy of this particle using a modified Born approach [Eq.~\eqref{eq:born}]:\begin{align}
	&\Delta G^\star_{P}(P^z) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \frac{q^2}{2fa_0}\,\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}-1\right]\,\erf(\mu\,a_0\,|q|),
\end{align}
where $f$ and $\mu$ are method-dependent factors, the latter being described in Ref.~\cite{matsuiDensityFunctionalTheory2013} as a parameter to induce a screening effect near the redox center.


In the presence of this fictitious particle, the reduction of $X^z$ becomes:\begin{equation*}
	\begin{array}{rl}
		X^z + n_e\,e^- &\rightarrow X^{z-n_e} \\
		P^{-z} \phantom{ + n_e\,e^-} &\rightarrow P^{n_e-z} + n_e\,e^- \\
		\hline
		X^z + P^{-z}&\rightarrow X^{z-n_e} +P^{n_e-z}\\
	\end{array}  \label{eq:corr}
\end{equation*}
and therefore,\begin{align}
	E^p_{abs}(X^z|X^{z-n_e}) &= 	E_{abs}^0(X^{z}|X^{z-n_e}) -\frac{1}{n_e\,F}\,[\Delta G^\star_{P}(P^{n_e-z}) - \Delta G^\star_{P}(P^{-z})] \nonumber\\
	&= 	E_{abs}^0(X^{z}|X^{z-n_e}) -\frac{\Delta\Delta G^\star_P}{n_e\,F}, \label{eq:matsui} 
\end{align}
where:\begin{align*}
	\Delta\Delta G^\star_P&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{2fa_0}\,\left[\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}-1\right]\times\nonumber\\
	&\left[ (n_e-q)^2\,\erf(\mu\,a_0\,|n_e-q|)-q^2\,\erf(\mu\,a_0\,|q|)\right].
\end{align*}
Matsui and co-workers proposed to  find the parameter $f$ and $\mu$ so that they minimize the difference between $E^p_{rel}(X^z|X^{z-n_e})$  [from Eq.~\eqref{eq:ecalc}] and the experimental $E^0_{rel}(X^z|X^{z-n_e})$.  Note that they therefore considers that $ E^{0}_{abs}(\text{SHE})$ is a third fitting parameter.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodo}

In this study, the set of nitroxides considered by Hodgson \textit{et al.} (compounds \textbf{1}-\textbf{54}) is examined, supplemented with a few additional compounds for completeness (\textbf{55}-\textbf{61}). All structures are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:nitroxides}. The \ce{AC} pair, consisting of \ce{BF4^-} (\ce{A^-}) and \ce{NMe4^+} (\ce{C^+}), is used as the electrolyte. These molecules were chosen because they serve as good models for the electrolytes used in the experimental measurements discussed in Section \ref{sec:exp}. While other pairs have been shown to have a larger effect on the redox potential \cite{wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a}, the trends among the families and substituents should remain consistent.

\begin{figure}[!p]

Experimental (reduction or oxidation) potentials are available in water if the number is written in red, while they are available in acetonitrile if the number is underlined.}
\label{fig:nitroxides}
\end{figure}

Geometry optimizations and subsequent vibrational frequency calculations were performed at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-311+G(d) level in water and acetonitrile (described using the SMD \cite{marenichUniversalSolvationModel2009} approach) with Gaussian 16 C02 \cite{g16}. With other possible candidates, this functional have been demonstrated to  provide reliable geometries (see Ref.~\citenum{wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a}) and results  \cite{flores-leonarFurtherInsightsDFT2017,maierG4AccuracyDFT2020} (see also Fig.~S4).  For compound \textbf{1}-\textbf{54}, the geometries obtained by Hodgson et al.~\cite{hodgsonOneElectronOxidationReduction2007} have been used as a starting point, taking advantage of their extensive conformational search. All radical forms are considered to have a doublet ground state  [$\braket{S^2}=\frac{3}{4}$]. Then, the same calculations were preformed in acetonitrile for the subset of compounds for which experimental redox potentials are available (listed in Fig.~\ref{fig:nitroxides}). The geometries of the complexes (Fig.~\ref{fig:cip}) were then optimized at the same level of approximation, for which different positions of the counterions have been assessed (\textit{vide supra}). Finally, to study the influence of the substituent on the redox potential with the model presented in Section \ref{sec:eleczhang}, single point calculation are performed at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-311+G(d) level in gas phase, using the optimized geometries of  the radical states of each nitroxides (in water) in which $>$\ce{N-O^.} moiety is substituted by \ce{CH_2} (the rest of the geometry is kept fixed).

Since all thermochemical quantities are $\kappa$-dependent, analyses were performed using custom Python scripts. When required (e.g., in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dh}), the value of $a$ (the radius of the solute cavity) is taken as half the largest distance between two atoms in the molecule. Although this is an approximation, it provides a consistent method to treat all molecules proportionally to their size and is consistent with other publications \cite{matsuiDensityFunctionalTheory2013}.  Furthermore, a value of $\varepsilon_{r,wa}=80$ for water and $\varepsilon_{r,ac}=35$ for acetonitrile is used. These relative permittivities correspond to those of the pure solvents and are known to be lower in the respective electrolyte solutions \cite{silvaTrueHuckelEquation2022}. These variations can be substantial; for example, $\varepsilon_r \approx 70$ for a solution containing \SI{1}{\mol\per\kilo\gram} of \ce{NaCl} in water \cite{kontogeorgisDebyeHuckelTheoryIts2018, silvaTrueHuckelEquation2022}, but they depend on the nature of the electrolyte, so it was not considered here.


Unless otherwise mentioned, the value of $\kappa^2$ is obtained assuming  $c_{ox} = c_{rad} = c_ {red} = \SI{1e-3}{\mole\per\liter}$, a prototypical concentration in measurements.

\section{Results and discussion} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Structure-activity relationships} \label{sec:sar}


Oxidation and reduction potentials of nitroxide radicals in water, grouped by family, are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:family} (see also Table S1). Compared to \textbf{1}, modifying the molecular structure or adding substituents generally increases both the oxidation and reduction potentials. Regarding structural impacts, six-membered ring compounds (P6O and APO) exhibit higher reduction potentials than their five-membered ring counterparts (P5O and IIO). Additionally, the incorporation of one or two aromatic rings (IIO and APO) enhances both the oxidation and reduction potentials.


\begin{figure}[!h]

	\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{Figure8}
	\caption{Relationship between absolute oxidation and reduction potentials of nitroxides, as computed at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-311+G(d) level in water (SMD), with $[\ce{X}]=\SI{0}{\mole\per\liter}$. The color indicate the family (Fig.~\ref{fig:nitroxides}). For each of them, an ellipse is drawn, centered on the mean potential value among the family, and which width and height are given by the standard deviations.}
	\label{fig:family}
\end{figure}

Regarding the impact of substituents, it is noteworthy that non-substituted nitroxides within each family (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{2}, \textbf{14}, \textbf{23}, and \textbf{36}) generally have some of the lowest oxidation and reduction potentials within their respective groups. Several trends emerge based on the nature of the substituent: \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item shielding the radical center with ethyl groups instead of methyl groups (\textbf{7}, \textbf{19}, and \textbf{28}) results in a decrease in potentials (particularly the reduction potential), likely due to changes in inductive effects,
	\item protonation of \ce{NH2} (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{4} vs \textbf{11}) increases the potentials, especially in P5O,
	\item multiple substitutions by COOH (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{8} vs. \textbf{9} and \textbf{10}) also increase the potentials, though the effect is less pronounced in IIO and APO,
	\item compounds with mesomeric donor substituents (\ce{NH2}, \ce{OH}, \ce{OMe}) have lower potentials than those with acceptor substituents (COOH, \ce{NO2}), particularly in aromatic systems (IIO and APO), and
	\item compounds \textbf{56} and \textbf{58} have surprisingly low reduction potentials.
\end{inparaenum}
As a consequence, \textbf{55} exhibits the highest oxidation and reduction potentials among all the compounds studied in this paper.

To elucidate these effects, attempts are made to correlate both potentials with Hammett constants for P5O and P6O, but the correlations are found to be very weak, especially for reduction (see Fig.~S5). The electrostatic interaction model [Eq.~\eqref{eq:Er}] provides more insights. Results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:corr} (see also Table S4). It should be noted that this model fails to account for the effect of substituting methyl groups with ethyl groups. Moreover, including the disubstituted compounds (e.g., \textbf{9}) worsens the correlation ($R^2 \sim 0.5$ and 0.3 for oxidation and reduction, respectively). Compounds \textbf{56} and \textbf{58} remain outliers for reduction. Therefore, all three sets of compounds are treated as outliers in the following discussion.

Though the correlation is lower for reduction than for oxidation (probably because the electron delocalization means nitrogen is not the atom that should be used to define the origin in that case), this model helps explain some of the observed effects. For instance, the increase in oxidation (and reduction) potential for aromatic compounds correlates with an increase in quadrupole moment ($Q_{xx} > \SI{5}{\elementarycharge\bohr\squared}$ for most members of IIO or APO). Additionally, modifications due to donor/acceptor substituents are linked to changes in the dipole moment. For example, aromatic compounds with \ce{NH2} as a substituent (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{51}) are characterized by $\mu_{x} < 0$, which increases for compounds with \ce{COOH} (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{39}) or \ce{NO2} (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{54}). 

This model also accounts for some effects due to the position of the substituent (see, e.g., \textbf{49}-\textbf{51}), which was not the case with the original model by Zhang and co-workers (resulting in weak correlations, $R^2 \leq 0.3$). Furthermore, members of P5O generally present a smaller value of $E_r$ than P6O (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{17} versus \textbf{5}), which correlates with the increase in oxidation potential observed between these two families. The same trend is observed between APO and IIO.

Finally, although this model is not directly applicable to charged substituents (\textbf{11}, \textbf{21}, and \textbf{35}), for which the multipole moments are ill-defined, the leading term $q/r$ results in a positive contribution to $E_r$ (and a destabilizing interaction with \ce{N+} and \ce{N^.}, while stabilizing \ce{N-}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:dipole}), which correlates well with the increase in oxidation and reduction potential for these compounds.

\subsection{Impact of the solvent} \label{sec:solv}

The solvent exerts a significant stabilizing effect on the charge. In the gas phase (Table S2), $E^0_{abs}(\ce{N+}|\ce{N^.})$ values are around \SI{7}{\volt} (and up to \SI{10}{\volt} for \textbf{11}, \textbf{21}, and \textbf{35}), while $E^0_{abs}(\ce{N^.}|\ce{N-})$ values are approximately \SI{0.3}{\volt} (around \SI{3}{\volt} for \textbf{11}, \textbf{21}, and \textbf{35}). The modifications due to the solvent, primarily resulting from the stabilization of the charges (as indicated by the Born model), but also including moderate geometry changes, amount to about \SI{2}{\volt} (\SI{200}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}).

The difference between redox potentials computed in water and acetonitrile is reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:watvsac} (see also Table S3):  the oxidation potential is only minimally affected, while there is a disparity of greater than \SI{0.5}{\volt} for the reduction potentials. In first approximation, the Born model [Eq.~\eqref{eq:born}] can, again, account for these findings: for oxidation, the change in potentials in the two solvents, $E^0_{ac} - E^0_{wa}$, is proportional to $\varepsilon_{r,ac}^{-1}-\varepsilon_{r,wa}^{-1}$, which is positive (assuming that \ce{N^.} is neutral, which holds true for the subset of compounds considered here), whereas for reduction, it is proportional to $\varepsilon_{r,wa}^{-1}-\varepsilon_{r,ac}^{-1}$, which is negative. Since this impact is systematic, similar trends (in terms of the impact of substituents) between redox potentials in water and acetonitrile are observed.

\subsection{Impact of the electrolytes} \label{sec:elect}

So far, the concentration of electrolyte, $[X]$, has been maintained at zero. To evaluate its impact on the redox potentials, the DH correction itself is initially examined in Fig.~\ref{fig:DH}. As anticipated, it remains small within the concentration range considered here (a few tenths of millivolts for $[X] \leq \SI{1}{\mole\per\liter}$ and larger in acetonitrile), increasing with $[X]$. Its sign differs between oxidation and reduction potentials. Additionally, it is diminished for compounds belonging to the IIO and APO families (as they are larger molecules with larger $a$), but amplified for species with a net positive charge (\textbf{11}, \textbf{21}, \textbf{35}), for which the correction for oxidation and reduction potentials is negative.

Filled (empty) markers represent the correction to the oxidation (reduction) potential. }

\end{figure}

\clearpage

Next, the formation of ion pairs is addressed. As noted by other researchers \cite{zhangInteractionsImidazoliumBasedIonic2016,wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a}, the position of the ions significantly impacts the complexation energies. In practice, it is observed that there are two possible positions for the counterion (see Tables S5-S6 and an example in Fig.~\ref{fig:pos-anion}):
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
	\item near the redox center ($>$\ce{N-O^.}), "in front" of the methyl groups, and
	\item near the substituent, "behind" the methyl groups.
\end{inparaenum}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Figure12}
\caption{Impact of the counterion position (a) or (b) on the distance between the counterion and the redox center (the nitrogen in the oxidized form, $>$\ce{N+=O}, or the oxygen in the reduced form, $>$\ce{N-O-}), and on $\Delta G^\star_{cplx}$, using compound \textbf{4} as an example. Calculations were performed at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-311+G(d) level in water (black) and acetonitrile (blue).}
\label{fig:pos-anion}
\end{figure}

In both solvents, the radical (\ce{N^.}) interacts with \ce{C+} in the first position \cite{zhangEffectHeteroatomFunctionality2018}. Then, in water, the complexation energies for the \ce{NA} and \ce{NC} pairs are positive and significant. The difference in complexation energies between the two positions is generally small (a few \si{\kilo\joule\per\mole}), but the second position is favored in most of the case. Interestingly, this results in a larger nitroxide-to-counterion distance, indicating a less significant electrostatic interaction between the redox center and the counterion and suggesting that the substituent also plays a role in lowering the complexation energy. Another contributing factor is the quadrupole-ion interaction due to the aromatic systems present in compounds from the IIO and APO families, which is particularly important in the \ce{NC} pair. Here, the difference in energy between the two positions is more pronounced.

In acetonitrile, however, the lower dielectric constant leads to reduced charge screening. A significant decrease (10 to \SI{20}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}) is observed for the \ce{NC} pair when \ce{C+} is near the nitroxyl group (first position). This aligns with the model for ion pair formation [Eq.~\eqref{eq:pair}], particularly considering the impact of the ratio between the radii of the cavities. Since \ce{NMe4+} has a larger radius (\SI{2.1}{\angstrom}) than \ce{BF4-} (\SI{1.5}{\angstrom}), the former is closer in size to nitroxides ($>$\SI{3}{\angstrom}). The second position remains generally favored in the \ce{NA} pair, though only by a few \si{\kilo\joule\per\mole}.

Using the most stable positions for each complex, the corresponding equilibrium constants are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:Kx1} (see also Tables S7-S8 and Fig.~S6). The average value in each family, in water, is also reported in Table \ref{tab:Kx1}. In general, $K_{11} < K_{01} < K_{21} < 1$, indicating that the interaction between the hydroxylamine anion and the cation is the most stabilizing. Furthermore, while these equilibrium constants are of the same order of magnitude ($\sim \num{e-5}$) for \textbf{1}, significant differences appear in the other families.

	\label{tab:Kx1}
\end{table}

In particular, in water, the equilibrium constants $K_{01}$ and $K_{21}$ for aromatic compounds, IIO and APO, are two orders of magnitude larger due to ion-quadrupole interactions. The latter family contains compounds with some of the lowest complexation energies. However, correlating the nature of the substituent with the complexation energy remains challenging. In the literature, perpendicular $\pi$-cation interactions are stabilized by electron-rich aromatic rings (and thus donor substituents), while $\pi$-anion interactions are stabilized by electron-poor rings (acceptor substituents) \cite{pappFourFacesInteraction2017}. Despite this, compounds with either donor (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{42}) or acceptor (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{54}) substituents exhibit small complexation energies, likely due to variations in ion positioning across different systems. Regarding acetonitrile, while $K_{21}$ increases for the reasons discussed, this is not necessarily the case for the other constants. 

A notable exception to thse trends is the P6O family, which shows larger complexation equilibrium constants for the \ce{NC} pair (with $\Delta G^\star_{cplx} > \SI{40}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$) than others. This is a geometric effect: in such compounds, the \ce{N+=O} group (in oxoammonium) occupies an equatorial position, while the \ce{N-O-} bond (in the hydroxylamine anion) adopts an axial position. Nearby methyl groups hinder electrostatic interaction in the first case, especially for bulky counterions such as \ce{NMe4+}, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pos-anion}. This effect is less pronounced in other families, where the skeleton prevents the oxygen from adopting such a position (particularly in IIO and APO), resulting in larger complexation equilibrium constants when the i ion is in close interaction with the redox center.

Finally, complexation to the \ce{AC} pair is considered (Fig.~\ref{fig:Kx2}, Tables S9-S10). Based on the positioning of the ions in the pairs that were previously discussed, for the \ce{NAC^-} and \ce{NAC^.} complexes, the cation is placed near the nitroxyl moiety, while the anion is placed near the substituent. The opposite is done for \ce{NAC^+}. As expected, the equilibrium constants are smaller (by about four orders of magnitude, $\Delta G^\star_{cplx} \sim \SI{50}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$) than the ones previously discussed. However, the trends are similar: for example, in acetonitrile, the \ce{NAC^-} complexes are more stable than the others, as also observed previously \cite{wylieImprovedPerformanceAllOrganic2019a}. The stabilization of \ce{NAC^.} is however less important in this work than observed by this team, probably because of the larger dielectric constant used here.

\subsection{Comparison to experiment} \label{sec:exp}

A comparison between theoretical (including all corrections discussed above) and experimental oxidation potentials is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:expvstheo}.\todo{This is not really $E^f$ for the moment ;)} Excluding compounds bearing an \ce{NH2} group (\textbf{51}, \textbf{57}, and \textbf{59}) results in an excellent linear correlation ($R^2>0.9$). The computed potentials for these compounds are higher (by $>\SI{0.1}{\volt}$) than the fit line, suggesting that the amine group might be protonated under the experimental measurement conditions. This is indeed consistent with other cases (\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{25} vs \textbf{35}) discussed in Section \ref{sec:sar}. The remaining results indicate that the method used in this paper tends to overestimate the oxidation potentials in water and systematically underestimate them in acetonitrile, with a large mean average error (MAE), indicating that the value for $E^0_{abs}(\text{SHE)}$ might not be appropriate in this solvent.

The dashed line is a linear regression.}

For comparison, the model by Matsui and co-workers \cite{matsuiDensityFunctionalTheory2013} is used in Fig.~\ref{fig:matsui}. The different parameters were determined by fitting the experimental data. It should be noted that for such an oxidation process (\ce{N+ + e- -> N^.}), the $\Delta\Delta G^\star_P$ correction [Eq.~\eqref{eq:matsui}] can only be positive. As a consequence of this limitation, while the corrected $E^0_{abs}(\text{SHE)}$  predicted by this model is slightly larger than the recommended value in water, it is lower in acetonitrile (but this value being smaller than in water is not in agreement with experimental data). Interestingly, this correction is similar to the value of the MAE reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:expvstheo}. Furthermore, while the slope of the linear regression improves in water, it remains the same in acetonitrile. Finally, both $f$ and $\mu$ are smaller than those reported by Matsui and colleagues, though they treated systems bearing more significant charges. Therefore, this model is not well-suited for this case.

The dashed line is a linear regression, obtained without the DH correction. }

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Random thoughts:\begin{itemize}
	\item We only focused on the impact of substituent. Other study do the counterion part.
	\item more of DH could be included (dipole, quandrupole)
	\item Temperature is higher in batteries?
	\item The impact remains moderate, but I hope I have provided keys in understanding interaction.\todo{check \cite{zhangInteractionsImidazoliumBasedIonic2016}}
	\item Ionic liquids needs to be addressed at some point ;)
\end{itemize}
